This is my repository to save all the problems 
I tried for this Year 2022 GOOGLE KICK START

The languange used for solving this problem is 
Pyhton 3.6, Solved in my way of understandning. 

Hope this helps in understanding for those who
struggle to find a solution for the answers and 
will be a good practice for me to note this and 
keep me consistently solving and participating 
in this competetion.

Note: The answers of these problems are only
uploaded and upated after the duration of competiton.
Therefore this is not supporting any malpractices 
or depromting the idea of trying out problems by oneself.
